# git-fancy
Git hook that emojifies your commit messages with project-defined emoji
codes. Since it's just a
[commit-msg hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_commit_msg), you
can use any tool to compose your emoji-charged commit messages, and
since each emoji code gets translated to Unicode, your commit messages
will look great in any Unicode-aware environment.
