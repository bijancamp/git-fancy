# git-fancy
Git hook that emojifies your commit messages with project-defined emoji
codes. Since it's just a
[commit-msg hook](https://git-scm.com/docs/githooks#_commit_msg), you
can use any tool to compose your emoji-charged commit messages, and
since each emoji code gets translated to Unicode, your commit messages
will look great in any Unicode-aware environment.

## Installation
Installation is simple:
1. Copy [commit-msg](commit-msg) to your hooks directory (by default,
the `.git/hooks` directory of your repository).
2. Add a `.fancyconfig` file at the root of your repository containing
definitions of emoji codes as described in
[Configuration](#configuration).

## Configuration
You define a project's emoji codes via a `.fancyconfig` file located at
the root of the repository. The format of `.fancyconfig` is the same as
that of a
[Git configuration file](https://www.git-scm.com/docs/git-config#_configuration_file).
Its sole section is `[emoji]` and contains definitions of custom emoji
codes in the format of *emojicode = emoji*, where *emojicode* is a
supported sequence of characters and *emoji* a sequence of Unicode
characters. For example, `fix = üêõ` defines the emoji code `fix` that
can be used to easily add `üêõ` to a commit message.

See [.fancyconfig](.fancyconfig) of this repository for an example
configuration.
